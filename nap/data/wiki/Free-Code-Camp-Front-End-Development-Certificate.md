We're creating a free Front End Development Certificate.

Here are the challenges that will make up our Basic Front End Development Certificate Program:

- HTML5 and CSS
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Basic JavaScript
- Basic Bonfires
- Ajax and JSON APIs (not available in the current version of the [Map](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map))
- Zipline: Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage
- Zipline: Build a Random Quote Machine
- Zipline: Show the Local Weather
- Zipline: Build a Pomodoro Clock
- Zipline: Zipline: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API

This won't be a new curriculum - it will just be the first 400 hours of our full stack JavaScript curriculum.

All campers who have already completed these challenges will retroactively be eligible for the certificate.
