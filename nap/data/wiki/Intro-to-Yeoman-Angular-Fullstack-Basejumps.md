> Hey FreeCodeCampers! This guide is here to help you navigate creating your first basejump. When I encountered the first basejump, I had no idea what was going on and spent weeks learning all of these things myself. Everything here is stuff I wish I had known coming into the basejumps. Oh and by the way, if you have a question that isn't answered by this guide, that's an issue, and you should report it as an issue to this repository! —[@clnhll](http://twitter.com/clnhll)

Yeoman is a tool that allows you to generate barebones apps based on different software stacks using “generator” packages made by developers who want to make your life easier. These packages streamline your time developing and deploying websites using your platform of choice. We’re using a full-stack MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) generator called generator-angular-fullstack by DaftMonk (https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack).

Once you’ve completed the Waypoint: Get Set for Basejumps, use this guide to navigate the base structure of your new app and learn how to interact with the database as well as the user.
