# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

```
function functionName (a, b) {
  return(a + b);
}
```

We can "call" our function like this: `functionName();`, and it will run and return it's return value to us.
