##Welcome to the Free Code Camp Wiki!

Our open source community's Wiki focuses on answering your questions about learning to code and getting a coding job. We also cover in detail our:
- Curriculum
- Local Campsite Communities
- Nonprofit Projects

"Wiki" is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick", and that is a good mindset to have when creating a Wiki. Please reference our [Wiki style guide] ([https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/Wiki-Style-Guide)) for more direction regarding styling.  <img align="right" src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/camperbot?&s=100">
