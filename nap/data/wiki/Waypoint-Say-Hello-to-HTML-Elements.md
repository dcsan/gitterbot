HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:

`<tagname>content</tagname>` The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

`<p>My first HTML paragraph.</p>`

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>`. Closing tags look like this: `</h1>`  Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.
