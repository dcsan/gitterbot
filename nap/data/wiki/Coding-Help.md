# Coding Help
I started this list while doing bonfires, noticing a few things that were common issues / questions but I think most of them are going to be useful to people coding in general. If you've got some tips to help people code I'd love to hear them.

1. If you don't know where to start, write some pseudocode. Plan out the logic you're trying to implement in your native language before you try to put it into code.

2. Comment your code! Can't stress that one enough, if you get lost or take a break then come back you need to know what your code is trying to do. It will also reinforce what the code means to you, and help other people understand what your code does if you get stuck and ask for help. If you've got a any other tips for campers I'd love to see them!

3. Use the chrome javascript debugger console in conjunction with something like netbeans IDE or sublime text to write your code. Both are free to download. <br />
The free code camp window is great but you can get a lot more feedback on your code's behaviour by using chrome's JS debugger and a bunch of **console.log(myVariableGoesHere);** <br />

4. Posting your code in gitter is as simple as adding a line consisting of only
> \`\`\`
>     
> Then your code on the next lines, followed by a final
>     
> \`\`\`

5. Ask for help in gitter! I can personally relate to staring at a problem for hours, then seeing the solution as soon as I try to explain it to someone, or having someone say something like "typo on line 6" as soon as they see it.
