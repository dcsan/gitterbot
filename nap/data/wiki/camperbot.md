Hi, I'm **[CamperBot](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/camperbot)**! I can help you in this chatroom :smile: 

### Basic Commands:
- ``find TOPIC``  find all entries about topic. ex: `find js`
- `wiki TOPIC` show contents of topic page
- `thanks @username`  send brownie points to another user
- `about @username`   shows info on that user
- `bonfire BONFIRENAME` info on a bonfire

## Help on Bonfires
Live currently on the HelpBonFires channel on Gitter
[https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/HelpBonfires)

We've added some bonfire specific commands. If you type `bonfire $BONFIRENAME` (where $BONFIRENAME is part of a bonfire name) it will set the chat to be about that bonfire. Then you can use some other bonfire specific commands:

- bf details - more info
- bf spoiler - show some hints

## More  commands
- `update`  pulls new wiki edits asap
- `topics` selected pages from the wiki
- `rooms`  all rooms the bot is in
- `archives` show history
- `music` link to FCC Plug rooms
- `twitch` show the twitch feed

## Content for the wiki
Feel free to make new pages, an example entry is here:

## Source Repository
### [https://github.com/dcsan/gitterbot](https://github.com/dcsan/gitterbot)
Fork it and have fun!

## Roadmap
We're looking for ideas for new features to add, and some people to help working on the bot.
Have a look at Tickets with [help wanted](https://github.com/dcsan/gitterbot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) on the repo and maybe you can contribute?

In future, we're planning:
- Bonfire step-by-step tutorials will be available via chat and from the CamperBot
- realtime tagging and searching of chats by topic
- a scripting language and natural language processing
Get involved and let us know what you'd like to see next!

## Developer Chatroom
- [Join us on our repository chat room](https://gitter.im/dcsan/gitterbot) to discuss new features. Perhaps we can pair up to work on the bot 2.0!
- [Join this chat room](https://gitter.im/camperbot/testing) to mess around with the CamperBot and try out commands, proofread your edits to wiki content etc.
